Hello,

after a fun Sunday I present you my submission for the Underhanded
Crypto contest.

It's a small protocol similar to Pond. The problem is that the server
can learn a bit more information than it should.

friends.txt is the Friends! protocol description. Please read that first.
generate_pass.py is a utility of the Friends! protocol.

friends_implementation.py is some code that exploits the
issue. Hopefully it helps understanding.

solution.txt is the solution of the problem.

Hope you enjoy, and hopefully I didn't fuck something up :)

Please let me know if you found it fun!
